# Graph Algorithms - Practical Work No. 5

## Problem Statement

**Task:**  
Given an undirected graph, find a **vertex cover** (a set of vertices such that every edge has at least one endpoint in the set) of size at most **twice the size of the optimal (minimum) vertex cover**.

**Constraints:**  
- The algorithm must run in **O(n + m)** time, where:
  - `n` is the number of vertices
  - `m` is the number of edges

**Requirements:**  
- Use the **abstract data type (ADT)** for graphs created in **Lab 1**.  
- Modify the ADT if necessary to support the implementation.
